Hacktech 2016 

This is an iOS application inspired by the awkward tension in asking roommates for requests/doing chores. 
Users in the same "house" can send simple "ping" messages, which is a simple icon and a short message
as a reminder to perform an action (eg. Take out trash, clean your dishes, wipe floors...)
